This repository contains a few python scripts for text mining. 
Some of these need pandas, numpy and scikit-learn. 

1. tf-idf_logistic_regression.py is a document classification model using logistic regression on tf-idf vectors. Input is tab separated file containing text entries with binary labels. e.g. emails labeled spam/non-spam, webpages labeled relevant/non-relevant etc. 

2. summauzation.py implements a simple multidocument summarization. It uses graphical methods, similar to unweighted-PageRank algorithm.
